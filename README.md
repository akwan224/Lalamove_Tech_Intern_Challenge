# Technical Challenge - Lalamove
## Tech/Infrastructure Intern

* First time writing a golang program, was a thought provoking and interesting challenge.  
* Approached this challenge by first reordering the releases[] *semver.Version by Ascending Order, and then filtering out the versions that were less than minVersion

* Looking forward to hearing back! Regards, Alvin
